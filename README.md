# Slytherin

This pygame version of snake was written by me for fun in Summer 15'. I will
always be updating and fixing bugs, so please do not hesitate to inform me if
you find any.

I used py2app to create a standalone Mac OSX application to bundle my pygame
scripts. To play, download the included zip file and extract. All code has been
included.
